diagnostics_triage_help: yes, because the author had themselves configured a CSS selector and a text condition in the display and visibility rules. This was working fine, but it just showed up on a different element or a wrong element. So diagnostics could have been used as a false positive checker where the tooltip was showing up on a different element and it could also have been used to see if the conditions added were working as expected, which in this case they were. But the problem here was that it was showing up on the wrong element. The flow step was showing up on the wrong element. 

diagnostics_fix_help: no, Because diagnostics cannot detect a latching issue, it just displays what element was found. And in this case, the wrong element was found successfully. So it would have said element found successfully. In this case, the support agent had to understand the use case. And based on the use case, they were nudged towards adding a proper selector that identified the right element. instead of the selector that was added by the author themselves.
